#Final Project

##Details

The name's Crockeo, and this is my final project for the CS50x class, Crocode. It's a simple interpreted language for
basic arithmetic and logic. It's a simple ~~people~~ project with nearly no real-world value, but it's to show all that
I've learned throughout the course.

There will be tested compatibility with Windows and Linux, though chances are (given that it's written in Python) that
there will be complete support for Max OSX as well.
