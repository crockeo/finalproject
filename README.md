#Final Project

##Details

The name's Crockeo, and this is my final project for the CS50x class, Crocode. It's a simple interpreted language for
basic arithmetic and logic. It's a simple ~~people~~ project with nearly no real-world value, but it's to show all that
I've learned throughout the course.

There will definitely be compatibility for Windows and Linux. At least that's the only platform's I'll be able to test
for. Mac OSX may get 'official' support if I get a platform for OSX on.

1. Find someone to compile it on there
2. Find someone to debug it on there.

Until that happens, it's only _definitely_ going to be on Windows and Linux. It'll probably still compile fine on Mac
OSX, though.
