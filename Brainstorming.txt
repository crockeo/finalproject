(Some Brainstorming Ideas For My Final Project)


* a game (I'unno what kind)

* some sort of encryption (more complicated than a caesar cipher)

* some sort of compression

* some sort of image editor/viewer

* a web-portfolio of my work (or lack thereof :P)

* a simple git GUI

* finally implmenting Crocode completely (game library) along with (possibly) a demo of some kind

* a simple interpreted language (probably just basic if, else, for, while, printing, and math)
