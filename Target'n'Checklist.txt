(Target features of the final project, along with a checklist for the progress)

PROJECT: Simple interpreted language

  - Implement static mode which loads files and feeds each line into the evaluator
  - Implement basic printing and set up evaluation for it
  - Implement variables and set up evaluation for them as well
  - Implement arithmetic and set up evaluation for it
  - Implement if, then, else, and, of course, implement evaluation for it
